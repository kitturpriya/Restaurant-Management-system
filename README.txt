Restaurant Management System

The Program is written in C++ and uses standard libraries and functionalities
of C++.

1) Extract the rar file.
2) You will get a folder named DSA inside there you will get a 
DSA_Project_Restaurant_Management_System exe app. 
3) Run it.
DONE.

PS: The command window might initially be of a small size and thus
might not print the entire content.

If the command window is small then Right click on the top menu bar
of the command window and go to 
Properties > Layout 
and there you can change the window size to (150x40) recommended.
or any width and height of your choice. Thankyou.
